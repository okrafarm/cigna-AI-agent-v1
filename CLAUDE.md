# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository appears to be in its initial state with only a README.md and .gitignore file. The .gitignore is configured for a Python project, suggesting this will be a Python-based application.

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal structure:
- `README.md` - Empty project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Python-focused gitignore with additional entries for Abstra framework, Cursor IDE, and Marimo

## Development Setup

No specific build, test, or development commands are available yet as the project appears to be in initial setup phase. Future development will likely involve Python with potential frameworks indicated by the gitignore entries:

- **Abstra** - AI-powered process automation framework
- **Marimo** - Interactive Python notebooks
- Standard Python development tools (pytest, ruff, mypy, etc.)

## Notes for Future Development

When the project structure is established, typical Python commands to look for:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` or similar dependency installation
- `python -m pytest` for testing  
- `ruff check` and `ruff format` for linting and formatting
- `mypy` for type checking

The gitignore suggests this may involve AI/automation tooling, so be prepared for ML/AI-related dependencies and workflows.
